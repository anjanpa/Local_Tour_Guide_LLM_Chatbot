# Local Tour Guide Django

A Django-based web application for guiding users through local tour experiences. The app provides information about various local cultural, historical, and tourist sites based on user queries, integrating a chatbot that answers questions about local culture, history, hiking, religious sites, and more in their native language.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple navigation to explore different locations and categories.
- **Tour Categories**: Supports `religious`, `cultural`, `hiking`, `history`, and `places to visit`.
- **Multilingual Support**: Answers user queries in their native language.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Engages users in real-time, providing context-based answers using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **Search Functionality**: Integrated semantic search pipeline for efficient retrieval of location data.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Uses FAISS for storing and querying local tour information.
