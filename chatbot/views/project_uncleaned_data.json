According to Hindu mythology, during ancient times, Kathmandu suffered from drought for 12 years. The rivers dried, and people started to get worried. Then, the King of Bhaktapur, Narendra Dev, went to meet tantric Shantika. Tantric Shantika said that Guru Gorakhnath is furious and is meditating on a cushion of 9 powerful serpents. As long as the serpents are not released, the rain will not fall. For the serpents to be free, Guru Gorakhnanath must stand from his meditation position. It is possible only if his teacher Rato Machhindranath visits him. Machhindranath, also known as Karunamaya, was reborn as the 108th son of a demon king, Sashi, of Yaksha desh, Assam. King Narendra from Bhaktapur, Tantric Bandu Dutta, and a Jyapu named Ratna Chakra from Lalitpur went to Assam to receive Karunamaya. The demon king was not ready to give them his child, so the tantric Bandu Dutta summoned four Bhairavs. The four Bhairavs then bring Karunamaya to Bungmati. Upon seeing Rato Machhindranath, Guru Gorakhnath stands from his mediating position releasing the serpents. And then, it is said that the rain started to fall. The four wheels of the Rato Machhindranath chariot refer to those four Bhaiarvs. The chariot procession starts from Pulchowk of Lalitpur and is pulled along Natole, Gabahal, Mangal Bazaar, Sundhara, Lagankhel, and Kumaripati. The chariot journey ends in Jawalakhel where the ceremony of Bhoto Jatra is conducted to conclude the festival. The bejeweled tunic is displayed to mark the end of the festival. Since the festival is celebrated as per the Lunar calendar, it does not have a fixed date. "}, {"title": "Gai Jatra", "description": "Primarily celebrated by the Newari people,Gai Jatrais celebrated as a remembrance of the departed souls. The festival lies in August/September and has a changeable date as it follows the lunar calendar. The members of the deceased family send a cow for the Parade. In the morning, the cow is bathed and worshipped, they put tika on their body and embroidered them with colorful garlands. However, the availability of cows has lessened over the period thus young boys are dressed as cows and sent for the procession. As these boys pass through the city, people offer them money, food, and gifts with the hope of getting lucky in the future. It is a beautiful festival encompassing amusement, laughter, dancing, and singing. The festival lasts for eight days. The festival started in the 17th century after King Partap Malla lost his son. The demise of the beloved son dragged his queen into the unending misery. His queen would stay sad and depressed all day. The miserable condition of the queen became unbearable to the king. Every tactic of cheering the queen failed. So to make his queen understand that death is inevitable and everyone has to go through it, he organized the procession where one person from every family that has lost someone during that year should participate. The locals could say funny things about the powerful people and the social norms on this particular day without fear. The flamboyant procession was to pass along the main gate so that the king and the queen could observe it. While the parade was passing through the palace, he explained to the queen that the people presented in the festival had lost someone. The queen finally realized she was not the only person who suffered the loss of a loved one and despite that, they were trying to be happy and took part in the festival. Then, she finally smiled. King\u2019s happiness knew no boundaries and he announced that the festival is to be observed every year. "}, {"title": "Mha Puja", "description": "Mha Puja, worship of the self, is celebrated by the Newari community annually to empower and cleanse one\u2019s soul. This festival marks the start of the Newari New Year as well. It takes place duringTihar: one day after Lakshmi Puja. The same day is also celebrated as Goverdhan and Goru Puja. The ritual starts with drawing a circular diagram called a mandala on the ground for every single member of the family. Two more Mandalas are drawn for messengers of death. Additional diagrams are drawn for the household items like a broom, winnowing tray, and water pitcher. After offering prayers to the mandala along with ritual food, flowers, incense, sacred thread, etc, they sit in front of the Mandala with the crossed leg. The lady from the house puts a tika on their forehead and places a long burning wick next to the mandala then offers them fruits and sacred threads. In the next part, women walk down the line with a pot filled with curd, every member offers some curd to one\u2019s temple. The members are given ritual food. At the end of the ritual, every family member enjoys the feast. The bronze plate filled with food is placed above the mandala. The main menu comprises eight items signifying eight grandmother goddesses who are considered as protectors. After the feast, they leave the room as it is and clean everything including plates and floor only the next day. "}, {"title": "Kuchhi Bhoye", "description": "Kuchi Bhoye, a Newari Feast takes place on the eighth day ofDashain. The eighth day of Dashain is also known as Maha Ashtami. On this day, the Newar community celebrates Kuchhi Bhoye by preparing their signature style of native dishes. It\u2019s a grand feast that brings the family together in chatter, laughter, and fun. Everybody from the family gathers at the home of the oldest members. All the family members sit on the ground for the bhoj. Several dishes are served on a banana leaf. 25 to 30 differentvegand non-veg dishes are served including Aila (a local liquor), Samay baji, choila, aloo ko achar, Khasi ko masu, bodi, bara, Bhutan, bhatmaas, aloo Tama, sidra, etc. This Newari festival strengthens the family bond since family members gather at one place and enjoy the time together eating feast. "}, {"title": "Chaite Dashain", "description": "Chaite Dashain is observed in Chaitra, the last month of the year according to the Bikram Sambat calendar. The festival lasts only for two days. On the first day, Ram Nawani is observed and on the second day Dashami. The festival holds the same significance as the 10th day of Bijaya Dashain. During Ram Nawani, devotees keep fast and offer prayers in Lord Ram\u2019s temple. During chaite Dashain, Hindus worship Goddess Durga and sacrifice animals to please the goddess. According to Hindu mythology, Ram, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu was born on the day of Ram Nawami. Thus, people started to fast and offered prayers to celebrate this day. And Chaite Dashain is celebrated as the day Ram returned to Ayodhya from 14 years of exile with his wife Sita and brother Laxman. "}, {"title": "Mohani", "description": "Newa\u2019s Dashain, Mohani holds great significance among Newari people. Like any other festival in Nepal, this festival as well brings the families together under the same roof. Family gatherings, pilgrimages, religious services, and celebrations that last for several days make this festival awaited. Since bhoj is an integral part of the Newari community, this festival as well features special dinners that continue for weeks. Mohani is a celebration of the triumph of good over evil. Though the festival is celebrated for more than two weeks, the most important events occur from the 8th to the 11th day of the festival. On the first day, barley seeds are planted in the sand in earthen bowls in the room where the deity is installed. On the fifth day, a parade is held to honor the deity Panchali Bhairav. On the eighth day, Sikali Jatra takes place which encompasses religious rituals and dance performances. Lakhe dance is observed in Bhaktapur for five days. On the same day, a special bhoj, Kucchi Bhoye, is held. Around 30 mouth-watering dishes are prepared on this day. Sacred rituals like worshipping metal tools are performed on a ninth day. The tenth day is called Chalan. On this day, family members gather in the shrine room and receive tika and blessings from the elders. After that, another grand feast is organized. During Mohani, most of the people indulge themselves in traditional sport, Kite flying. It is believed that the kite takes the message to heaven to end the rains for the year. As per Hindu mythology, Durga, the Goddess of power slew the evil-spirited Mahisasur who was creating havoc in the world. After a multi-day war, Durga finally killed him. Durga\u2019s triumph over Mahishasur is proof that evil cannot win. Likewise, the demon Chunda was killed by Goddess Chamunda. So to celebrate the victory of right over wrong, Mohini started. Newar has the most varied and interesting festivals. Apart from the festivals mentioned above, the Newar community celebrates many more events. But one thing is always common, and that is the exotic \u2018Bhoj\u2019. You will always find yourself amid interesting events throughout the year. Thus, you will always get a rewarding festive experience no matter the time of the year you are visiting Nepal. I hope after reading the Newari Festivals blog post, you get to know more knowledge about newa culture. If you have any feedback please feel free to comment below or email us. "}, {"title": "Finding history in Kathmandu", "description": "Everyone knows about temple-studdedDurbar Square, the ceremonial heart of old Kathmandu, where centuries-old temples and palaces are slowly being restored to their medieval glory after the devastating earthquake of 2015. The sublime Buddhist stupas of Boudhanath andSwayambhunathare almost as famous, thronged by a constant tide of sightseers and devotees. But history in Kathmandu is not a musty museum exhibit, it\u2019s a living thing. You\u2019ll feel its pulse as you squeeze your way through the crowded bazaars ofAsan ToleandIndra Chowk, or duck into backstreetbahals(courtyards) where locals practice cottage industries, surrounded by statuary and carvings that would be locked away in a museum anywhere else in the world. Essential stops to get a feel for old Kathmandu includeItum Bahal, a medieval monastery courtyard that provides a sudden haven of calm after the frenetic street scenes outside, and theKathesimbhu Stupa, a scaled-down version of the great stupa at Swayambhunath, in a stupa-studded square reached through a bazaar of \u201cBuddha shops\u201d selling prayer flags and other Buddhist essentials. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say you\u2019ll have some of the most memorable meals of your life in Kathmandu.

Stupas and monasteries.Hike Duration:depending on the route, 3 to 6 hours. Champadevi is in the southeastern corner of the Kathmandu Valley and is technically in Makwanpur District. There are several routes to reach the summit, but the most popular, and easiest to access is one that takes you along the Dollu Valley through pine forests and along the grassy ridge top. This route starts fromHattiban Resortand the trail is well trodden and easy to follow. From the resort, the trip will take around three hours, there and back. Parking is available at the bottom of the steep, gravel road to the resort (for bigger vehicles or if you want extra walking time) or at the resort itself. A less used and longer route begins just after theDakshinkali Templeroad, beyond Taudaha Lake. This route sees you walking along dirt roads through fields until you reach the forest where the trail climbs steeply through the forest to reach the ridge above Haatiban Resort. \u00a0This will take you from 4 to 6 hours. As mentioned, there are several routes, and some other start from thenorth side of the Pharping Valley(starting from Pharping village) and lead you north to the summit of Champadevi. These routes are more tricky to identify. Bring a map and do your homework before starting out! Getting There (For Individual Trekkers) Buses leave every day from the Old Bus Park (15 minutes walk from Thamel). Just go along and ask for a bus to Dakshinkali. Getting off at the road for Haatiban Resort is more tricky as the conductor might not know the resort name.

"}, {"title": "Ancient Kathmandu valley", "description": "Archaeological explorations indicate that Kathmandu and the two other sister towns in the valley were the oldest towns and are traced to the period between 167 BC and 1 AD. Excavations conducted at Hadigaon and Lubhu in southern part of the valley, in Kathmandu, have unearthed brick walls andStone Agetools. In 1992, workers digging a trench for the foundation of a house in Maligaon in Eastern Kathmandu discovered a life size (171 x 49\u00a0cm) standing male figure carved in pale sandstone, clearly made in theKushanstyle. The sculpture was donated by an early Licchavi or pre-Licchavi monarch, named Jaya Varman with an inscription on the pedestal. Although the identity of the figure is contested, it is the authors'[who?]opinion that it is likely Jaya Varman himself who is portrayed. It is the oldest known inscription from the Kathmandu Valley. \"The inscription on this sculpture, clearly dated to samvat 107, most likely corresponding to AD 185, provides this previously missing evidence, and pushes back the epigraphical documentation of royal rule in the Kathmandu valley nearly three hundred years.\"[2] The geological setting of the valley points to the existence of alakenear Chobar gorge on theBagmati River, below the presentPashupatinath Temple, which was a pilgrimage place during the period of the Buddha. This lake is said to have been drained byManjushreeBodhisattva, a Buddhist saint, by cutting open an outlet in the southern rim of the valley. As a result, the valley that was created was fertile and people started cultivating here and building their homes here. As the valley grew, Manjushree is said to have worshipped Swayambhu on the hillock where the present Swayambhu temple is located.[citation needed]He also founded the city of Manjupatan, which today lies within the present Kathmandu Metropolitan area,  located betweenSwayambuandGujeswarinear the airport. He even declared his disciple Dharmakarma as the ruler of that city.[1] The reign ofAbhir dynastyof eighth rulers and theKiratissaid to be originally of the northeastern hill region of India (700 BC). Their succession of 29 rulers reigned here until theLichhaviscame into power.[citation needed] Fourstupasaround the city ofPatan, near Kendra Hiranyavarna Mahavihara (called \"Patukodon\"), 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) far away from Kathmandu, is said to have been erected byCharumati, attests to the ancient history.[1]"}, {"title": "Licchavi Kingdom (400\u2013750)", "description": "During the reign of theLicchavis(400\u2013750 A.D.), two adjoining settlements, Yambu or Thahne (\u2018Yambu\u2019 in Nepal Bhasa means the field of Kathmandu and Thahne means higher ground that lies to the north side also called \u201cnorthern land\") and Yangal/Kwone (\u2018Yangal\u2019 in Nepal Bhasa means the depressed area of Kathmandu, Kwone also means \u201csouthern land\") formed Kathmandu, also known as Koligram. Koligram is believed to be settlement ofKoliyas, some of whom migrated to Kathmandu valley afterMahajanapadaera.[3]Yambu is the area north of present-day Makhan Tole, next to theDurbar Square. The southern sector, called Yangal, is also known as Dakshin Koligram; and a neighborhood by this name (Yengal) exists in the city today.[1]The Licchavi king Gunakamadeva founded a city in between these two settlements on the bank of Bishnumati river called Kantipur. The city was formed in the shape of aChandrahrasa(Manjushri's sword) mentioned inSwayambhu Purana,[4]which was used to drain Nagdaha to create the Kathmandu valley and fortified with 8 barracks which were guarded byAjimas. According to folklore, Gunakamadeva dreamt of being asked to found a city by Laxmi (or Kanti),[5]so the city was formed in her name, Kantipur. According toNepal Sambat, the city is believed to have been founded on the auspicious date of Yenya Punhi, with the founding stone laid by Gunakamadeva at Maru Tole, which is still present. In order to appease relations between the citizens of Yembu and Yengal, the king is believed to have started a festival where theMajipa Lakheydance of Kone (Yengal) and Pulukishi dance of Yembu (Thahne) were performed together along the main road of the newly formed city connecting the two settlements (now called Gunakamadeva Marg). The festival is still celebrated as Yenya or Indra Jatra today but the main focus of the festival has shifted to Indra and Kumari over a long period of time. A marketplace was formed at the center of city in a circular shape (Chakrakar) according to Tantric traditions.[5]A temple, dedicated toBhimsen, the god of merchants, was built at the center of Bhimsenthan to attract merchants.[5]However, very few trade passed through theHimalayasbetween India and China during this period, and the founding of this fortified city provided a secure trading point, promoting trade between the two markets and boosting the economy of the city. This also had a profound effect on the culture of the city, and brought a diversity of ethnicities, religions and cultures together harmoniously.[citation needed] The Licchavi were inBiharduring theMahajanapadaera and Licchavi inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit with their particular script closely related to officialGuptascripts. The Lichhavi, having lost their political fortune in India, came to Nepal, attacking and defeating the last Kirat King Gasti.[citation needed] There were 48 Licchavi rulers, including Mana Deva I, who ruled from 464 and had been referred to as their greatest ruler.[1]A connoisseur of art and architecture, he introduced the Pagoda roofed architecture, erected exquisite sculptures  and built the temples of Changunarayan, Vishabjynarayan, Sikhomanarayan and Ichabgunarayan. The reclining Vishnu ofBudhanilkantha, the gilded roof of the Pashupatinath Temple, the struts of Hanuman Dhoka and theBasantapur Tower, the Uku Bahal in Patan, and the Indreshwar Mhadev Temple at Panauti are all credited to Mana Deva.[1]"}, {"title": "7th to 8th century", "description": "The famous Chinese Buddhist monk,Xuanzang(Wade-Giles: Hs\u00fcan-tsang), spent about two years between 637 and 642 CE at the great university ofNalanda, which is almost directly south of Nepal. It is not certain that he actually visited Nepal, but he left a fascinating account of it, the capital city which we know as Kathmandu, and its king, which, presumably, dates from this period: The Chinese sentPrincess Wenchengto marry the Tibetan king in 641 CE. Following this, the ChineseEmperor Taizong of Tangsent an envoy via Tibet to the great Indian EmperorHarsha. Another larger mission under Wang Xuance sent in 647-8 was robbed of the gifts they were carrying; some of the emissaries were killed, others put in prison.  Narendradeva sent 7,000 troops with their allies, the Tibetans, attackedKanauj, theGuptacapital, captured the usurper, Arjuna, and his family, and sent them as a captives to China.[7]This was the last known official contact between China and India until the 13th century[8]and so, the following account of Nepal from theTang Annals, most probably dates to information brought back about that time: TheTang Annalsalso include the information that Narendradeva's father lost his throne to his elder brother and sought refuge in Tibet. The Tibetans re-established him on his throne and \"that is how he became subject to Tibet.\"[10] Thomas Watters says that theShih-ka-fang-chih(Pinyin:Shiga fangzhi), 'A record of the country ofSakya(muni),' which is dated 650 CE,[11]reports that there was at the capital, \"a large building in seven stories, above200 feet (61\u00a0m) high and 80 paces in circumference, the upper part of which accommodated 10000 [or, preferably, \"a myriad\"] persons; the chambers of this building had exquisite carvings, and were adorned with precious stones.\" There also was a Buddhist monastery \"in several stories and of fantastic shapes\" on a hill more than 10li[approx5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi)] south of the capital.\"[12] A Buddhist legend says Narendradeva retired to a monastery. He was followed by \u015aivadeva II who, although he was Hindu, was supportive ofMahayanaBuddhism. Seven inscriptions from his reign have survived covering the period from 685 to 701 CE. His wife, Vatsadev\u012b, was the granddaughter of Aditiyasena, the King of theMagadha. He was succeeded by his son, Jayadeva II, who married the daughter of the King of theGau\u1e0da region, in northeastern India, and whose inscriptions range from 713 to 733. These are followed by a series of inscriptions from a number of rather poorly known Licchavi rulers which range up to 879 CE, when King R\u0101ghadeva ascended the throne.[13]"}, {"title": "750\u20131200", "description": "The period 750\u20131200 is considered as a transitional kingdom in power in Kathmandu Valley, though concrete verifiable records are not available. According to custom, however, in the late 900s, Kathmandu was established by the King Gunakama Deva at the banks of Bishnumati river whose southern limit was marked by the confluence of theBagmati Riverand Bishnumati River in a place called Teku Dovan. The pre-existing settlements of Yambu and Yangal were merged into the Kantipur city. The town was planned in the shape ofManjushree's sword with the tip positioned to north and the base to the south, with the perimeter of Kathmandu defined by building temples of the eight mother goddesses (Ajima); which still exist today.  The important structures built in Kathmandu during this period were theKasthamandap,  amidst temples and narrow streets lined with multi-storey houses around theDurbar Square, with the old royal palace complex occupying the center stage. Thanhiti, an upper fountain, marked the southern section. Similar old water spouts, seen at several locations in the city, were a source of drinking water to the inhabitants residing in the vicinity.[1]"}, {"title": "Malla Dynasty (1200\u20131768)", "description": "Khasa Mall kings ruled in western Nepal during 1100\u20131484. However, Arimalla, first monarch of the Malla Dynasty, ruled in Kathmandu Valley from 1200 to 1216. Other notable rulers of the Malla dynasty were Jayasthitimalla who ruled as king of united Malla kingdom from 1382 to 1395 and Yakshamalla reigned from 1428 to 1482 at the height of united Malla kingdom. TheMalla dynastyperiod (1200\u20131768) witnessed further boost in enhancing the cultural heritage of Kathmandu by buildingpagodas, houses decorated with carved windows, exquisite open-air shrines and courtyards filled with brilliant sculptures. Kathmandu became a larger city and as observed by Father Giuseppe, aCapuchinmissionary, in the 1760s, 'Catmandu' contained about 18,000 houses.[1]During the 14th century, the dynasty was threatened and Kathmandu was subject to many attacks by outside invaders. In 1312, the Khasa king Ripumalla lead a raid in the Kathmandu Valley and in 1345\u201346 Sultan Shams ud-din Ilyas of Bengal invaded the city,[14]and theMughalsleft long lasting damage, destroying many earlier buildings and settlements which led to widespread reconstruction of the city. In 1484, the Malla kingdom divided into the three kingdoms of Kathmandu, Bhadgaon, and Patan.[14] Early modern Nepal began its evolution in the 16th century with the founding of the House ofGorkhaby Dravya Shah in 1559. During the rule of the Gorkhas there was further frenzied activity in building up the city.[1]Ram Shah of Gorkha reigned  from 1606 to 1633 and started expanding the Gorkha kingdom. Kings such asJitamitra Malla, King ofBhaktapurfrom 1673 to 1696 was noted in particular for his construction projects. In 1674, he built a Shikara-style Shiva temple with a gilded repousse mask of the God on each side in Bhaktapu. In 1682 he built, near the Durbar square, the two-storied Dharmasala Palace in which there is a goldenMahadeva.[15]The palace was used by royalty until 1769 and today is a museum and part of theWorld Heritage Siteon Durbar Square. To the east of this he erected the temple and statue ofNarayana, along with the temples of Dattatrikasa and Pashupati. An inscription in 1678 states that he built the royal palace Thanathu Durbar, its gardens and courtyard. Jitamitra was also credited with restoring Kumari Chowk, the images of Astamatrikas and in 1690, donated two large copper kettledrums (nagara) or bells to his favourite deity, the goddess Taleju for the gilded roof of Taleju.[16]He also contributed a finely carved woodentympanumabove the main entrance to the Mul Chowk and also erected many memorials in Bhaktapur.[15] His son,Bhupatindra Mallareplaced him after his death in 1696 and was equally as fascinated with architecture, and continued the development of the Dharmsala Palace, its 55 windows and gardens.[15]"}, {"title": "1769\u20131845", "description": "AfterJayayakshya Mallaconquered lands that was far larger than what Nepal had been before him, he decided to create a confederation for his sons so that they could rule the nation more efficiently. The Malla confederacy, with more than one ruler overlooking the nation, was more stable than the monarchial rule before. So, the monarchs focussed more on trade, arts and literature than in developing the army. By the time Prithvi Narayan Shah had ascended to the throne of Gorkha in 1743. When Prithvi Narayan Shah first attacked Kirtipur, the combined army of Malla confederacy defeated him and killedKalu Pandey, the Mul Kaji in theBattle of Kirtipur. Even after the conquest of Kirtipur and Kantipur in 1768 in theBattle of Kathmandu, the Malla confederacy fought from Bhaktapur, where, the rulers of all the three states of the Malla confederacy surrendered. By 1769 enabledPrithvi Narayan Shah, the king ofGorkha, to conquer the valley, forming the foundations for the modernKingdom of Nepal. Finally Gorkha conquered Kathmandu and Patan, Bhadgaon, eastern Nepal, and western Nepal between 1768 and 1790. Prithvi Narayan Shah, the first king of united Nepal died in 1775. In 1767, a request to theBritishfor help by the traditional valley kings under threat from Gorkha expansion resulted in an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 led by Captain Kinloch. The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkha army easily overpowered those who had not succumbed to malaria or desertion. This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhas with firearms and filled them with suspicion, causing some to underestimate their future opponents. This conquest of the Kathmandu valley was only the beginning of an explosion of Gorkha power throughout the region. The Gorkha armies had overrun all of eastern Nepal by 1773. Gorkha forces had also annexed some western portions ofSikkimand in 1788 seized their then capitalRabdentse. In the west, all rulers as far as theKali Riverhad submitted or been replaced by 1790. Farther west still, theKumaonregion and its capitalAlmorahad also succumbed to the Gorkhas. To the north however, aggressive raids intoTibet(concerning a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes) forced theChineseemperor inPekingto act. In 1792 he sent a huge army, expelling the Nepalese from Tibet to within 5 kilometres (3.1\u00a0mi) of their capital at Kathmandu. Acting regent Bahadur Shah, (Prithvi Naryan's son), appealed to the BritishGovernor-Generalof India for help. Anxious to avoid confrontation with the Chinese, the British sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator, but before he arrived the war with China had finished. The Nepalese were forced into signing a humiliating treaty revoking their trading privileges in Tibet and requiring them to pay tribute to Peking every five years. The Tibet affair had postponed a previously planned attack on theGarhwal Kingdom, but by 1803 Raja ofGarhwalPradyuman Shah had also been defeated. He was killed in the struggle in January 1804, and all his land annexed. Further west, generalAmar Singh Thapaoverran lands as far as theKangra\u2013 the strongest fort in the hill region \u2013 and laid siege to it (although by 1809,Ranjit Singhthe ruler of theSikhstate in thePunjab, had intervened and driven the Nepalese army east of theSutlejriver). The British were also expanding their sphere of influence. The recent acquisition of theNawab of Awadh's lands by the British East India Company brought the region ofGorakhpurinto the close proximity of the raja ofPalpa\u2013 the last remaining independent town within the Gorkha heartlands. Suspicion of the raja's collusion with the British led first to his imprisonment by the Gorkhas, then to his assassination.Bhimsen Thapa, Nepalese Prime Minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Gorkhas and the British. A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. Gorkha raids into the flatlands of theTarai, a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions \u2013 the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication betweenCalcuttaand the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the powers was inevitable. As a result of border tensions and ambitious expansionism conflict came to heads in theAnglo-Nepalese Warof 1814\u20131816 between theKingdom of Nepal(nowFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal) and theBritish East India Company. After the successful initial campaign by Ochterlony, however, the Kathmandu durbar failed to ratify the peace agreement signed on 28 November 1815. This reluctance to sign soon led to the second campaign. Unsurprisingly, Lord Moira placed Ochterlony in command of the 20,000 strong invasion force of Nepal. After the decisive Battle of Makwanpur on 28 February 1816 and the fall of the fort of Hariharpur, the Gurkhas were forced to surrender and as a result theTreaty of Sugauliwas ratified on 4 March 1816. Nepal lost Sikkim, the territories ofKumaonandGarhwal, and most of the lands of the Tarai; theBritish East India Companywould pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Tarai region. However, the Tarai lands had proved difficult to govern and some of them were returned to Nepal later in 1816 and the annual payments abolished. The Mechi river became the new eastern border and theMahakali riverthe western boundary of Nepal. Kathmandu was also forced to accept a BritishResident, a position that was loathed as it was seen as a symbol of its reduction to client status in relation to the British administration inCalcuttaunder theBritish Raj."}, {"title": "Modern history (1846\u20131999)", "description": "With the Shahs establishing their rule over the Gorkhas, dictatorship ensued, with Ranas becoming all powerful. Jang Bahadur Kunwar was the first Prime Minister in 1846 followed by succession of Rana prime ministers, which lasted till 1950. Rana rule from Kathmandu was mainly governance by a landed aristocracy, with the parliamentary government functioning only as a facade. Even though there was stability in the country, political and economic development was on the backburner with the Ranas adopting isolation of the country with absolute total control over domestic affairs. All this was possible because of support of the army. During all this period, Shahs  asMonarchswere figurehead monarchs, while the real power rested with the Ranas.[1]The Nepali Congress Party was founded in 1946, diplomatic relatshionship was established with USA and. In 1948 the country's first constitution, the Government of Nepal Act, was promulgated. But Prime Minister Padma Shamsher Rana resigned in the wake of opposition to the new constitution from conservative Ranas and Mohan Shamsher becomes prime minister; constitution is suspended. By 1950 Ranas fell into open conflict with King Tribhuvan as they suspected Nepali Congress Party's conspiracy against Rana power was instigated by the King. The king then sought and was granted asylum in India. at this stage, Government troops rebelled and over 140 Ranas joined the dissidents. During this period a Treaty of Peace and Friendship and Treaty of Trade and Commerce was signed with India. The1934 Nepal\u2013Bihar earthquakedamaged many parts of the city. However, they were later rebuilt to their original form. From the 1980s, the city has witnessed a building boom with farmlands within the city limits getting converted into urban building developments with the old core area getting encircled by high-rise buildings of business houses, wide boulevards and upscale residential suburbs.[1] However, in January 1951, the tide turned in favour of monarchy of Shahs, when the Ranas were forced to surrender all executive powers: financial management, appointment of government officials, and command of the armed forces to the Monarchy. Mohan Shamsher capitulated and King Tribhuvan was restored to the throne. Several Prime Minsires took executive control ending with the king assumin direct rule.[17] Local elections to a municipal councilwere first held on 9 September 1953. Candidates nominated by the illegalCommunist Party of Nepalgot 50% of the total votes cast. Out of a total of 19 seats, six were won by communists, four by Nepali Congress, four by Praja Parisad, one byGorkha Parishadand four byindependents.[18] Amongst the elected communists was the chairman of the council, Janak Man Singh. However, his tenure became short. A jurisdictional dispute emerged between the municipal council and the national government. A no-confidence vote removed Singh from his office and the national government banned him from entering the municipal council office. Singh was arrested when attempting to enter the office, and was jailed.[19] Following the death of King Tribhuvan in 1955, Mahendra assumed power.[15] During this period Nepal joined the United Nations, National Police Force was formed, In the 1950s many events occurred such as the signing of border treaty with China, the USSR opening an embassy at Kathmandu and the United States opening an embassy at Kathmandu in 1959. A new constitution was also promulgated in 1959, superseding Constitution of 1951. The first general elections were also held in 1956 with the Nepal Congress Party winning absolute majority; and the Tribhuvan University was founded. In December 1960, King Mahendra abolished the multiparty democracy and brought in the Panchayat Raj into force. This was fully controlled by the Monarchy.[20]In 1962, King Mahendra adopted a new constitution, the third since 1951, and established the centrally controlled partyless council system of governance called panchayat. This system served as the institutional basis of the king's rule. The palace claimed it a democratic administration although it functioned only at the king's behest. It was then established at the village, district, and national levels. Even with successive changes in executive wing of government in Kathmandu and constitutional revisions, the absolute powers of the monarchy remained solid. Land Reorganization Act and Mulki Ain, new legal code, were also promulgated. But political unrest simmered as the events testify: In 1963 after Emergency was lifted Panchayat elections were held and the National Guidance Council was formed.  In 1965, the local government was reorganized.  In 1971 a new trade and transit treaty was negotiated with India from Kathmandu. In 1972 King Mahedra died and was succeeded by King Birendra. Development regions were established under National Development Council.[15] But a fire in the same year burns down Singha Durbar, the seat of government. King Birendra was crowned in 1973. He soon thereafter launched the \"Go to the Village\". In the May 1980 referendum while reaffirming the status quo of the panchayat system, against the reintroduction of political parties and concurred continuation rule by the king. Elections in 1981 and 1986 were characterized by the lack of political programs. Political turmoil continued. Second election to Rastriya Panchayat were held in 1986; [15] In 1989, failure to renegotiate trade and transit treaties with India disrupted the economy. Following this in 1990 demonstrations for the restoration of democracy were held. On 9 April 1990, the King restored the multi-party democracy with due lifting of the ban on agitating political parties. Panchayat system was dissolved and an interim government made up of various parties and king's representatives was formed with promulgation of new constitution.[21] Following restoration of multi-party democary, the first general elections to Parliament were held on 12 May 1991, under the new constitution. Nepali Congress won a narrow majority and G.P. Koirala became prime minister. But President of Nepali Congress and interim prime minister, K.P.
